- customized right click menu for thumbnails (delete thumbnail,refresh/reload 
  maybe and open in foreground and background tab options)

http://groups.google.com/group/taboo-extension/browse_thread/thread/2f345e9114f5cdda
- add comments to taboos
- searching full text

- embed taboos within bookmarks...

- in grid mode, it would be nice to be able to edit the title of the taboo
- calendar mode it would be nice if the thumbnails were a little bigger, so you can recognize your taboo faster

This release:
  undelete link isn't visible any more (deleting in grid)
  unable to delete from mosaic
  save/cancel on textarea are at wrong place

Idea from Johan
- when bookmarking an image (visiting the image url), snapshot to fit the image dimensions, instead of the browser width, with white padding on the right and bottom
