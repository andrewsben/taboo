- Right now there is 1 hotkey: Ctrl-Shift-F - "find a taboo" - which
  opens the page of tabs.  Add hotkey for tabooing the current page and 
  then make both costomizable via prefs.
- customized right click menu for thumbnails (delete thumbnail,refresh/reload 
  maybe and open in foreground and background tab options)

- in grid mode, it would be nice to be able to edit the title of the taboo
- calendar mode it would be nice if the thumbnails were a little bigger, so you can recognize your taboo faster
